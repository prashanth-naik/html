    <p>Book Name : <strong > A Boys's Will </strong> </p>
      <p> A Boy's Will is a poetry collection by Robert Frost. It is Frost's first commercially published book of poems.<p>

    <h3> Overview of the Book</h3>
    <p>Frost admitted that much of the book was autobiographical. </br>
  the proof sheets were printed in January 1913, he wrote the poems were "pretty near being the story of five years" of his life.</br> 
Specifically, Frost noted that the first poem of the book, "Into My Own", </br>
expressed how he turned away from people and "Tuft of Flowers" showed how he "came back to them".</br> 
In fact, some of the poems were written as early as two decades earlier.</br>
Frost was apparently pleased with the book and wrote to a friend shortly after its publication, </br>
"I expect to do something to the present state of literature in America."</br>
Like much of Frost's work, the poems in A Boy's Will thematically associate with rural life, nature, philosophy, and individuality,</br>
while also alluding to earlier poets including Emily Dickinson, Thomas Hardy, William Shakespeare, and William Wordsworth.</br>
Despite the first section of poems having a theme of retreating from society, then, Frost does not retreat from his literary precursors and, instead, tries to find his place among them. </br>
The title of the book comes from the repeated lines in the poem "My Lost Youth" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow: </br>
"A boy's will is the wind's will / And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts". The line is, in turn, a quote from Olaus Sirma in Lapponia (1675). </br>
Frost likely chose the title as a reflection of his own wayward early life.</p>
